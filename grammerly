I have already done a project in python specifically in OpenCV which titles "Security Surveillance".
The project generates an alarm whenever the person crosses the camera and YOLOV3  neural network was used for object detection in videos .  So , I hope the internship will increase my knowledge in Computer Vision . And also I am really intersted in this internship.
